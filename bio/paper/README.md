  UCETD LaTeX Class & Template
============================

This repository includes a soon-to-be-official LaTeX class and template for
correctly formatted electronic Ph.D. dissertations at the University of Chicago.

The [official format specification][spec] can be tough to meet from scratch.
That's why we are providing this class and template. The class, when properly
used as in the template, will make sure your dissertation meets the spec.

Of course, there are lots of ways this can go wrong, especially if you aren't
a hardcore LaTeX guru. Special circumstances, doing seemingly innocuous things
just barely wrong, and other easy mistakes can create formatting problems. We
are working to make the class more robust, but if you need any help with LaTeX
and its quirks, or end up with formatting problems you can't fix, you can ask
the current maintainer of this package
(presently [Michael Victor Zink](mailto:mvzink@uchicago.edu)) to help you out.
